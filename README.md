<h2> 🛣️ Joshua's Cybersecurity Journey </h2>
  My journey in cybersecurity began after high school when I initially aspired to be a programmer. However, after more than a year of studying programming, I realized it wasn't the right path for me. It was then that my father encouraged me to explore cybersecurity. I delved into the field, and I soon discovered that it's a profession in high demand worldwide.

  I decided to commit myself to the study of cybersecurity seriously. I started by exploring resources from foreign YouTube channels and honed my skills by participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) games from various platforms around the world. This journey continues to this day, and I remain dedicated to learning, evolving, and continuously enhancing my skills.
